The idea in here is to approach some topics like networking, databases, communication patterns and everything else in the middle that relates to backend engineering.

* Backend communication
	 There are different patterns and way to do communication on the backend, like request-response, pub/sub, synchronous and asynchronous communication and many others.
	 
	 Request-Response: A request is sent to the back-end, the back-end processes it and sends the response back. The client sends a Request, the server parses the Request, processes it and sends a Response.

	 It is used in the Web, HTTP, DNS, SSH
