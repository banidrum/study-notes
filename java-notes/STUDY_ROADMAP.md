# JAVA STUDY ROADMAP

The idea in here is to develop a personal roadmap for me to study Java

## Java

- Best Practices

- Collections

- Error Handling

- JVM (Maybe not so deep, just the basics for start)

- Build Tools

- Testing (Integration and Unit)

## Spring Boot

- ORMs

- JDBC

- Beans

- Authentication/Authorization

## Project ideas

- Spring Boot CRUD

- Something that consumes AWS Services

- See how Messaging works in Java

- Something with RPC

- A project that uses cache

## Books that seems to be good

- Effective Java

- Spring in Action

- Java Concurrency in Practice
