# Java Collections

Some notes on Java Collections, how they work and what they are used for.

Collections are data structures.

Most of them aren't thread safe by default.

## Map

It isn't possible to instantiate a map, so we use HashMap instead. There are some variations like TreeMap, WeakHashMap.

You can't have duplicate keys on a Map-like structure.

## List

To declare an ArrayList, we do the following:

`ArrayList<T> name = new ArrayList<>();`

Where T is the type of the items that will be on the ArrayList.

Can be sorted.

Allows duplicates.

Its size is dynamic.

## Vector

## Queue

## Set

Sets don't allow duplicate elements.
