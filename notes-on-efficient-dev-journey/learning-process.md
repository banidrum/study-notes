Things that can help with the learning process:

- Study in a quiet place without distractions
- Try to keep focused during the study time

Another thing that is very important on the learning process, is finding ways to easily retrieve information.

Some examples are:

- Read the same information multiple times
- Summarize what you did
- Take notes on what you understood, and most important, what you **DIDN'T** understand

In case of it being knowledge related to coding, do a lot of coding exercises that will help you to fix that knowledge

It is really important to have a well defined objective, and have a way to measure how close you are from this objective.

Schemas are the super power of our long term memory. They help to improve our working memory

It is really important to focus on only one thing per time

## Code

Try to look for the number of branches that appear in the code (basically anything with {} is a branch). The lower the better. Conditionals are branches, functions as arguments are branches

Separation of concerns is really important

Each indirection makes the code harder to read, so let's try to avoid them

Cohesion means how you are using the attributes from your class

Example: if you have a class with 3 attributes, each method of the class should use these attributes. This can be considered a class with 100% cohesion

A class with an intelligent state, rarely is 100% cohese

Form value-object: Instead of creating another class to map the DTO and use it later, we could use the class itself to do this map. There's nothing wrong with it.
